To run the project code, 
    Open "Car Price Prediction.iypnb" file, and locate the "4. Loading Data" section.
    Look for a variable or configuration related to the data loading path. It was named "path".
    Update the value of this variable with the correct path to your dataset.
        # Example in Python code
        path = "/your/dataset/path"

Here is the list of libraries we used in our code:

    statsmodels - for statistical models and tests.
    numpy - for numerical operations and arrays.
    pandas - for data manipulation and analysis.
    zipfile - for unzipping cars.csv.zip
    matplotlib - for creating visualizations and plots.
    seaborn - for additional data visualization, including heatmap.
    sklearn - for all modeling and metric evaluations

Please ensure statsmodels, numpy, pandas, zipfile, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn are installed before you run the program.
Note: The program is expected to run for a total duration of 17 minutes
