To run the project code simply use the run all feature of the Car Price Prediction.iypnb file.

Coding: Car PricePrediction.ipynb
Dataset: cars.cvs.zip 
Final Report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zhQrkWmJjjMU6wIfBC78MygGzp-XUrkaUOWALfyAL9Q/edit

Here is the list of libraries we used in our code:

    statsmodels - for statistical models and tests.
    numpy - for numerical operations and arrays.
    pandas - for data manipulation and analysis.
    zipfile - for unzipping cars.csv.zip
    matplotlib - for creating visualizations and plots.
    seaborn - for additional data visualization, including heatmap.
    sklearn - for all modeling and metric evaluations

Please ensure statsmodels, numpy, pandas, zipfile, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn are installed before you run the program.
Note: The program is expected to run for a total duration of 17 minutes
